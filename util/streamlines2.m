function streamlines2(v, S, stepsize, maxit, cmap, lineWidth)
%STREAMLINES2 Plots integral curves in the plane.
%   
%   STREAMLINES2(v, S, stepsize, maxit, cmap, lineWidth) takes a vector 
%   field v and plots colored integral curves for an artificial time. The
%   number of steps is given by maxit. S are seed points of the integral
%   curves in R^2. cmap is used to interpolate colors. lineWidth is the
%   line width used for plotting.
%
%   Note that line segments are plotted with increasing time so that they
%   may overlap previously drawn segments.
