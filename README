3. Requirements

This software was originally written for and tested with Matlab R2016a.

The following libraries are required for parts of this sofware:

export_fig: used for producing high quality figures from the results.

URL: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-exportfig

4. Usage

For easier use we provide a startup script (startup.m), which sets up the 
Matlab search path. It includes required libraries and adds required 
subdirectories. Make sure to download the required packages and to set the 
library paths properly. Then simply run the startup script.

To run the test cases execute

>> runtests('test')

Note that test/readlsmTest.m requires a certain LSM file to be available 
(set via datapath.m)!

In order to run the software with real data set the path to your files
in the script:

- datapath.m.

The following run scripts are included:

- TODO add scripts.
